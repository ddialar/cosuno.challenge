# Cosuno coding challenge

Create a simple React application that shows a list of construction companies, each with the
following information:
- Company name
- Logo (you may use a placeholder image, e.g. using https://placekitten.com/)
- Specialties (e.g. Excavation, Plumbing, Electrical)
- City

The following should be possible:
- Search for a company by typing into a search field. The search term gets matched only
against the company name and the list of companies is filtered based on the search term
in real time as the user is typing.
- Filter the list using a set of checkboxes to include only those companies which offer a
particular speciality (e.g. only Plumbing).

Create a simple API based on Node.js that returns the list of companies to the frontend. The
API can read the data from a simple JSON source, no database setup is required.

In addition, make a list of ideas on how you would improve this application if you had more time
to work on it.

# Non edited content

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
